# üóÑÔ∏è Employee Management SQL Project  

This project demonstrates **SQL fundamentals to advanced concepts** using an `Employee Management` database.  
It covers **DDL, DML, TCL, Joins, Aggregates, Subqueries, CTEs, Window Functions, and Set Operators** with practical examples.  

---

## üìå Project Overview  

- Created a **relational database** with 4 tables:  
  - Employees üë®‚Äçüíº  
  - Departments üè¢  
  - Projects üìä  
  - EmployeeSalaries üí∞  
- Inserted **sample data** to simulate a real-world scenario.  
- Performed **60+ SQL queries** to practice and demonstrate different concepts.  

---

## üèóÔ∏è Database Schema  

### 1. Create Database & Tables  
![Database and Employees Table](https://github.com/Vishalmorya380/Employee-Management-SQL-Project-End-to-End-Database-Querying/blob/main/Create%20databse%20and%20Table%201.png)  
- Defines the `EmployeeManagement` database.  
- Creates the **Employees** table with constraints.  

### 2. Departments Table  
![Departments Table](https://github.com/Vishalmorya380/Employee-Management-SQL-Project-End-to-End-Database-Querying/blob/main/Create%20Table%202%20and%203.png)  
- Stores department info like `DeptID`, `DeptName`, and `OfficeLocation`.  

### 3. Projects Table  
![Projects Table](https://github.com/Vishalmorya380/Employee-Management-SQL-Project-End-to-End-Database-Querying/blob/main/Create%20Table%202%20and%203.png)  
- Stores company projects with `StartDate` and `EndDate`.  

### 4. Employee Salaries Table  
![Salaries Table](https://github.com/Vishalmorya380/Employee-Management-SQL-Project-End-to-End-Database-Querying/blob/main/Create%20Table%204.png)  
- Maintains salary, bonus, and deduction details.

### üîπ Section 4: Aggregate Functions  
![Aggregates](https://github.com/Vishalmorya380/Employee-Management-SQL-Project-End-to-End-Database-Querying/blob/main/Aggregate.png)  
- Count employees, average salary, max/min salary.  
- Group employees by department and gender.  

### üîπ Section 5: Joins  
![Joins](https://github.com/Vishalmorya380/Employee-Management-SQL-Project-End-to-End-Database-Querying/blob/main/Joins.png)  
- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN.  
- Employees with salaries, departments without employees, etc.  

### üîπ Section 6: Subqueries & CTEs  
![Subqueries and CTEs](https://github.com/Vishalmorya380/Employee-Management-SQL-Project-End-to-End-Database-Querying/blob/main/Sub%20Queries.png)  
- Salary above average, second highest salary.  
- CTEs for ranking and net salary.  

### üîπ Section 7: Window Functions  
![Window Functions](https://github.com/Vishalmorya380/Employee-Management-SQL-Project-End-to-End-Database-Querying/blob/main/Window%20Function.png)  
- RANK, LEAD, LAG, SUM OVER, MAX OVER.  
- Analyze salary distribution, cumulative salary, percent contribution.  

### üîπ Section 8: Set Operators  
![Set Operators](https://github.com/Vishalmorya380/Employee-Management-SQL-Project-End-to-End-Database-Querying/blob/main/Sets.png)  
- UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, EXCEPT.  
- Compare employees, departments, and projects.

## üí° Insights  

1. **Workforce Size**  
   - Found **total employees = 10** across the organization.  
   - Useful for **HR headcount analysis**.  
---
2. **Salary Distribution**  
   - Average employee salary ‚âà **‚Çπ57,500**.  
   - Salary ranges from **‚Çπ48,000 (lowest)** to **‚Çπ70,000 (highest)**.  
   - Helps in **compensation benchmarking**.  
---
3. **Department Analysis**  
   - IT department has the **highest salary budget = ‚Çπ2,46,000**.  
   - HR and Finance show **lower headcounts but competitive avg salaries**.  
   - Finance & IT departments have **avg salaries > ‚Çπ60,000**, showing they are higher-paying units.  
---
4. **Top Earners**  
   - Employee **Emily (‚Çπ70,000)** ranks #1.  
   - Salary ranking query provides a **clear hierarchy of pay levels**.  
---
5. **Employee Comparison**  
   - Identified employees earning **more than John (‚Çπ60,000)** ‚Üí Mike, Tom, and Emily.  
   - Helps managers spot **peer benchmarks**.  
---
6. **Data Integrity**  
   - No employees exist without salary records (validated via **EXCEPT query**).  
   - Confirms **clean database linkage**.  
---
7. **Set Operations**  
   - Compared Employee & Department datasets using **UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT**.  
   - Verified **consistency of DeptIDs** across multiple tables.  
---

8. **Business Decisions Enabled**  
   - **Compensation fairness check** across departments.  
   - **Resource allocation**: IT is salary-heavy, HR/Finance are leaner.  
   - **Retention risks**: salary gaps highlight potential employee dissatisfaction if not addressed.
